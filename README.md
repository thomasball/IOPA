<u>README of IOPA</u>

We propose IOPA, a parallelism control mechanism that can adapt to I/O capability of
the system. The IOPA monitors status of I/O sub-system and correspondingly adjusts 
the number of file-accessing threads in applications, by using a parallelism adjustment
algorithm. Programming interfaces are also provided to programmers.

Now, We are applying software copyright and developing IOPA 2.0 version, so all the codes 
should be modified at this time. If someone wants to cooperate with us and make IOPA
commercialization, please contact me at any time, and the email address is thomasball@126.com.

We will update this project aperiodically. Thank you very much for your attention.
